🌍 **About Me**  
I am a learner of the ALX ProDev Frontend Programme and I’m currently on a mission to complete the programme to stand out in my job search and future career.

💡 I chose software engineering because I love solving real-world problems through code.

🔥 I’m passionate about open source, building useful tools, developing scalable apps, AI and automation and I’m constantly inspired by tech communities, innovators like Elon Musk and impact-driven projects.

🎯 **My Vision**  
My goal is to "build software that creates impact", "contribute to global open-source projects", "work on products that reach millions".

💻 That’s why I want to work on projects involving "web apps", "system design", "machine learning", "API development", "automation tools.
